## About

This project's objective was to build a platform game similar [gamedevacademy](https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-create-a-turn-based-rpg-game-in-phaser-3-part-1/).The main idea is from the tutorial but I developed my own RPG with different levels.

The assignment can be seen [Here](https://www.notion.so/RPG-game-f94a617841e240a293c0b6928beebe89).

## The game

this is a turn-based game where you will have three characters, the game start with the first character (prospector) , you will be using him to find the enemies **spolier alert!!! they are hiding so you can't see them. move around and check every corner** when you find the enemies you will have your two other characters **Herus** and **ninja** to help you fighting the enemies. select the character you want to use with **keyboard arrows** and attack the enemy with **space**. the game has three levels and as you
progress you get stronger enemies and higher score.
###### 0- 50 level 1
###### 50- 200 level 2
###### 200- ++ level 3
on the left, of the screen, you can see the leader board and each time you break your record it will be automatically be updated on the leader board

### How to play
As explained in the previous section this is a turn basd game you will have two turns before the enemies get their own.
Use **![wasd][wasd]** to select the character you want to use and the enemy you want to attack, and press ![space][space] to attack the selected enemy.
